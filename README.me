# Urban Road Scene Segmentation & Object Detection: DeepLabV3+MobileNetV3, DeepLabV3+ResNet101, YOLOv8/v10, Data Preparation & Evaluation Scripts

This repository contains all code, dataset preparation scripts, training pipelines, and evaluation tools used for urban scene understanding in the context of object detection and semantic segmentation.
The focus is on the application of **YOLOv8/v10** and **DeepLabV3** models with both **MobileNetV3-Large** and **ResNet101** backbones, across multi-city, multi-split experimental settings.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- **Semantic Segmentation:** DeepLabV3+MobileNetV3-Large, DeepLabV3+ResNet101 (PyTorch, Albumentations)
- **Object Detection:** YOLOv8, YOLOv10 (Ultralytics, multi-GPU)
- **Dataset Utilities:** Filtering, city-specific splitting, symlink management, statistics
- **Evaluation:** Per-class, per-city metric extraction, best/worst sample visualization
- **Failure Analysis:** Post-hoc error classification & visualization

Each script has its own detailed README at the top of the file.
